Probability aspects of firing have been mentioned or investigated for instance by Tow{\'{e}} and Amassian16 for the cerebral cortex and for the spinal cord by Lloyd and McIntyre10 and by Hunt7. In the peripheral nerve fibre it is shown that low frequency stimulation of about threshold strength, gives occasional responses of the axon (Fig.1). The significance of this phenomenon was recognised only by Pecher12-14. Here we would like to describe some aspects of this probability phenomenon. METHODS},

They show a 1/f spectrum and a Gaussian amplitude distribution and are related to the net flow of potassium through the membrane. When the average membrane voltage is made more negative by means of an external current, depolarizing deflections can be observed. They cause an asymmetry in the noise amplitude distribution and a marked increase in the subaudio spectral components of the noise. The depolarizing deflections can be attributed to batch-wise inflow of sodium ions. Possible mechanisms of both types of membrane voltage fluctuations are discussed.},

In order to be consistent with our present understanding of the perception of pitch, the device permits the independent stimulation of a number of electrodes. Furthermore, to electrically isolate the stimulus to small areas, there is the capacity to vary the current and set the threshold independently at individual electrodes. The phase and amplitude of the pulses to neighbouring electrodes with also be varied to assist in localizing the current flow. The pattern to stimulation to individual or groups of electrodes can also be altered to enable studies to be carried out to determine ways of conveying frequency and intensity information over a more normal dynamic range.},

@article{Gillespie1977,
abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the “reaction-rate equations”); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the “master equation”). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this “stochastic simulation algorithm” correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments df by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.

abstract = {1. Compound action potentials were recorded from certain muscle and cutaneous nerves in normal and chronically de-efferentated hind limbs of cats during stimulation of the appropriate dorsal spinal roots. 2. The peaks for groups I, II and III in the compound action potential were correlated with the corresponding peaks in the fibre-diameter histograms of the same de-efferentated nerve after processing it for light microscopy. 3. The scaling factor (ratio of conduction velocity in m/sec to total diameter in gm) was not constant for all sizes of fibre nor did it increase progressively with fibre size. Evidence is presented that a logarithmic relation between conduction velocity and fibre diameter is not appropriate. 4. In muscle nerves the scaling factor for fibres fixed by glutaraldehyde perfusion and embedded in Epon was 5-7 for group I afferent fibres and 4-6 for myelinated fibres in both group II and group III. 5. In cutaneous nerves the scaling factor was 5*6 for large fibres (group I or Afl) and 4-6 for small fibres (group III or A8). 6. The scaling factor for group I fibres is the same as was found previously for ac-efferent fibres, and that for groups II and III is the same as for y-efferent fibres (Boyd {\&} Davey, 1968). 7. The possibility that there is a clear discontinuity in scaling factor between fibres in groups I and a, and those in other functional groups, is discussed. 8. It is concluded that there must be some structural feature of a and group I fibres which differs from that of smaller myelinated fibres. It is likely that a difference in the relative thickness of the myelin sheath is involved and possibly also in the conductances responsible for generating the action potential.},

abstract = {1. Voltage-clamp studies were carried out on single rabbit myelinated nerve fibres at 14 00 with the method of Dodge {\&} Frankenhaeuser (1958). 2. A method was developed to allow the ionic currents through the nodal membrane to be calibrated exactly under voltage-clamp conditions by measuring the resistance of the internode through which the current was injected. 3. The ionic currents in a rabbit node of Ranvier can be resolved into two com- ponents, a sodium current and a leak current. Potassium current is almost entirely absent. 4. The sodium currents in rabbit nodes were fitted by the Hodgkin-Huxley model using m2h kinetics. The kinetics of sodium currents in a rabbit node differ from that in a frog node under similar experimental conditions in two respects: (a) inactivation is faster, Th for rabbit being 2-3 times smaller around -50 mV; (b) the PNa (E) curve for mammal is shifted 10-15 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction. 5. From the kinetics of sodium current, the non-propagating rabbit action potential was reconstructed at 14 0C. The transient inward sodium current is respon- sible for the fast initial depolarization phase of the action potential, while the repolarizing phase is accounted for by leak alone. The computed shape of the action potential was in good agreement with the experimentally obtained action potential. 6. At 14 0, frog and rabbit nodes with similar diameters have similar measured gNa},

abstract = {1. Thresholds to electrical stimulation have been recorded, concurrently with the membrane currents ofconducted impulses, at many positions along undissected single fibres in rat spinal roots. 2. In normal myelinated fibres, distinct threshold minima invariably coincided with sites of inward current generation, and were therefore identified as nodes of Ranvier. Between nodes, the thresholds rose by an order of magnitude. 3. At normal nodes, the charge thresholds were linearly related to stimulus duration, as predicted by computer simulations ofa model myelinated fibre (Bostock, 1983). The strength-duration time constants averaged 64-9 + 8-3,sec (mean+ S.D.) at 37 TC, and had a Q10 of 1/1-39. They were relatively insensitive to changes in inter-electrode distance, or to partial anaesthetization with tetrodotoxin. 4. In fibres treated with diphtheria toxin 6-8 days previously, to induce paranodal or segmental demyelination, threshold minima were found both at nodes and in internodal regions generating inward membrane current. In these fibres strength- duration curves were of the same general form as at normal nodes, but with strength-duration time constants increased at widened nodes (up to 350,ssec) and at excitable internodes (600-725 ssec). Comparison with the computer model indicated that these changes were most likely due to exposure of axon membrane with a time constant much longer than that of the normal nodal membrane. 5. In none of the demyelinated fibres examined have we found any evidence of hyperexcitability. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {The atrophy of cutaneous (sural) and muscle (medial gastrocnemius) nerves proximal to a ligation were studied in cats for periods up to 9 months, using light and electron microscopy, conduction velocity measurements and computer simulations. As atrophy proceeds, nerve fibres become increasingly non-circular. Cross-sectional areas of axons and fibres (axon + myelin) were measured. The diameters of equivalent circles (having the same axon and fibre cross-sectional area) were then calculated. A linear relation was found between axon diameter and fibre diameter, but the slope decreased as atrophy continued. This indicates that the axon cross-sectional area decreases relatively more than the total fibre area. Reduction in conduction velocity correlates more closely with reduction in axon diameter than fibre (axon + myelin) diameter. The ratio of the inner (axon) perimeter to the outer (myelin) perimeter remains constant at or near the optimal value of 0.6 for conduction in all groups of fibres at all periods of atrophy. Futhermore, the thickness of the myelin remains constant for a given perimeter over the entire period of atrophy studied. This suggests that the number of turns of myelin and the length of each turn remain unchanged during peripheral nerve atrophy. A simple geometric model explains how this can occur without gaps developing between the axon and myelin or between the turns of myelin. The Frankenhaeuser-Huxley equations for conduction in myelinated nerve fibres predict changes in conduction velocity similar to those observed, if the axons atrophy without changes in myelin. The advantages of this mode of atrophy are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

At low stimulus intensities the CAP consists solely of the long latency N1 peak. As the stimulus strength is increased the higher threshold N0 appears. At high stimulus intensities N1 disappears and only the N0 component of the CAP remains. It is postulated that N1 represents action potentials propagated from the dendritic processes of the auditory neurons and that N0 represents action potentials initiated on the axons of these cells. The N1 peak exhibits anomalous refractory behavior which can be identified in the electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR). That behavior may be useful diagnostically in assessing the extent of dendritic degeneration in cochlear implant candidates and users.},

With sinusoidal currents thresholds for synchronization were 4-68 ?A rms.

abstract = {Discharge patterns of single auditory nerve fibers were recorded from normal-hearing cats implanted with a 12-band intracochlear electrode array. Stimuli were biphasic current pulses of specifiable width, amplitude, and rate. Acoustic tuning curves were obtained to determine the cochlear positions of the fibers. Response latencies to electrical stimuli formed two groups. Short latency (0.3 to 0.7 ms) responses were attributed to direct activation of spiral ganglion neurons. At high stimulus intensities, these often exhibited abrupt shifts toward even shorter latencies. Long latency ({\textgreater} 1.5 ms) responses were probably caused by electrophonic activation of functional hair cells. Response thresholds to electrical stimuli depended on a fiber's proximity to the stimulating electrodes, and they did not depend on a fiber's acoustic response threshold or spontaneous discharge rate. High intensity ({\textgreater}1.5 mA) stimuli could excite fibers over a wide range of characteristic frequencies, even for the narrowest (0.45 mm) electrode separations. Response threshold was an exponentially decreasing function of pulse width for widths up to 300 /is/phase. Fiber discharges were highly phase-locked at all suprathreshold intensities, and saturation discharge rates usually equaled stimulus pulse rates for rates up to at least 800 pulses/s. Dynamic ranges were small (I to 6 dB), increased with pulse rate, and were uncorrelated with electrical response threshold. Within the dynamic range, shapes of poststimulus time and interspike interval histograms resembled those obtained in response to acoustic stimuli. Depolarization block caused fiber activity to cease in 2 to 5 seconds for sustained stimuli presented at high ({\textgreater}600 pulses/s) pulse rates and intensities. It},

Comparative psychophysical studies with implanted deaf subjects indicate that animal models, at least nonhuman primates, provide a close match to humans, though this is not always true for acoustic stimulation of normal-hearing subjects. However, the human-animal comparisons, especially those involving electrical stimuli, need further study using more carefully matched conditions. Comparisons of psychophysical and neurophysiological thresholds for electrical stimulation in animals reveal consistently higlter thresholds in the neural studies. A number of factors which may account for these differences are discussed. A partial resolution of the problem could result from conducting neurophysiological and behavioral studies in the same animal. Finally, comparison of psychophysical and neurophysiolo{\~{}}c{\~{}} studies of temporal encoding suggest that there may be more information encoded in the auditory nerve than is used by the system, at least for nonspectral frequency discrimination.

The present study was designed to assess the sensitivity of that recording technique to variations in stimulation parameters. The experiments described in this paper demonstrate that: ( 1 ) the EAP as recorded in the cat is triphasic and is defined by two negative peaks occurring at latencies of approximately 0.26 and 0.82 ms; (2) EAP amplitude is independent of the level of the masker stimulus for current levels equal to or greater than the current level of the probe stimulus; and (3) the time course of recovery of the EAP from the refractory state is stable over a range of both probe and masker},

We here report patch-clamp recordings, both single- and multichannel, from acutely dissociated human axons. 2. Voltage-dependent sodium channels with a conductance gamma = 13 pS (measured in Ringer at room temperature) are found in the nodal area. 3. There are several types of voltage-dependent potassium channels: I channels (gamma = 34 pS), F channels (gamma = 50 pS), and channels with small conductance (gamma = 7-9 pS, all measured in high potassium solution). Most of them are closely similar to those already reported in Xenopus and rat axons; in addition a 200-pS, calcium-dependent potassium channel, similar to that in Xenopus, is present. 4. Differences between the electrical behavior of human axons and those of other species are probably not due to the presence of fundamentally different channel types, but may be due to differences in channel density or distribution. 5. As well as increasing our understanding of the basis of excitability in human nerve, this method may prove useful in the investigation of inherited and other human neuropathies.},

The kinetics of the nodes is based upon voltage clamp data in rat motor fibers at 37°C [18], while the resting membrane potential is computed with the Goldman equation. The resulting spike shape, conduction velocity, strengthlduration behavior, and absolute and relative refractory period are in good quantitative agreement with published experimental data in mammals at normal body temperature and at 20°C. Results at intermediate temperatures however, suggest that the widely used concept of a constant Q,, for the rate constants is invalid. In addition, the model generates realistic abortive spikes towards the end of the absolute refractory period and it can describe the consequences of repetitive firing. The results stress the advantages of a multiple nonlinear node model even if only time aspects of nerve behavior are under study. It turned out, that the model presented here de- scribes in vivo neural properties relevant for electrical prosthesis design better than previous models in literature.},

abstract = {(1) Single nerve fibre action potentials (APs) of lower sacral nerve roots were recorded extracellularly with two pairs of wire electrodes during an operation in which an anterior root stimulator for bladder control was implanted in 9 humans with a spinal cord lesion and dyssynergia of the urinary bladder. Roots that were not saved and that were used to record from were later used for morphometry. (2) Nerve fibre groups were identified by conduction velocity distribution histograms of single afferent and efferent fibres and partly by nerve fibre diameter distribution histograms, and correlation analysis was performed. Group conduction velocity values were obtained additionally from compound action potentials (CAPs) evoked by electrical stimulation of nerve roots and the urinary bladder. (3) The group conduction velocities and group nerve fibre diameters had the following pair-values at 35.5??C: Spindle afferents: SP1 (65 m/s/13.1 ??m), SP2 (51/12.1); touch afferents: T1 (47/11.1), T2 (39/10.1), T3 (27/9.1), T4 (19/8.1); urinary bladder afferents: S1 (41 m/s/-), ST (35/-); ??-motoneurons: ??13 (-/14.4), ??12 (65m/s/13.1 ??m), ??11 (60?/12.1)(FF), ??2 (51/10.3)(FR), ??3 (41/8.2)(S); ??-motoneurons: ??(??) (27/7.1), ??1 (21/6.6), ??21 (16/5.8), ??22 (14/5.1); preganglionic parasympathetic motoneurons: (10 m/s/3.7 ??m). (4) The values of group conduction velocity and group nerve fibre diameter measured in the paraplegics were very similar to those obtained earlier from brain-dead humans and patients with no spinal cord lesions. Also, the number and the density of myelinated fibres were preserved in the roots. Thus, the classification and identification of nerve fibre groups remained preserved following spinal cord lesion. A direct comparison can thus be made of natural impulse patterns of afferent and efferent nerve fibres between paraplegics (pathologic) and brain-dead humans (supraspinal destroyed CNS, in many respects physiologic). (5) When changing the root temperature from 32??C to 35.5??C, the group conduction velocities changed in the following way in one case: SP2: 40 m/s (32??C) to 50 m/s (35.5??C), S1: 31.3 to 40, ST: 25 to 33.8, M: 12.5 to 13.8; ??2: 40 to 50, ??3: 33 to 40. The group conduction velocities showed different temperature dependence apart from SP2 fibres and ??2-motoneurons. (6) Upon retrograde bladder filling the urinary bladder stretch (S1) and tension receptor afferent (ST) activity levels were undulating and increased. As compared to activity levels detected in a brain-dead human, S1 (designates afferents, not cord segment) and ST afferents fired, even when the bladder was empty, with an activity level similar to that observed in a brain-dead human with the bladder half filled. Two reasons are brought forward for a too small storage volume of the urinary bladder in paraplegics: too high afferent activity of the bladder due to changed receptor field signal transduction mechanisms and too low compliance.},

abstract = {Action potentials and membrane currents were recorded in single human myelinated nerve fibres under current- and voltage-clamp conditions at room temperature. Nerve material was obtained from patients undergoing nerve graft operations. Successful recordings were made in 11 nerve fibres. In Ringer's solution, large transient Na currents were recorded, which could be blocked completely with tetrodotoxin. Partial block of these currents with 3 nM tetrodotoxin was used to reduce the voltage-clamp error due to series resistance. Outward K currents were very small in intact nerve fibres, but had a large amplitude in fibres showing signs of paranodal demyelination. In isotonic KCl, the K current could be separated into three components: two fast components (Kf1 and Kf2) and one slow component (Ks). Time constants and steady-state activation and inactivation of Na permeability and of fast and slow K conductance were measured within the potential range of -145 mV to +115 mV. From these parameters, the corresponding rate constants were calculated and a mathematical model based on the Frankenhaeuser-Huxley equations was derived. Calculated action potentials closely matched those recorded. Single calculated action potentials were little affected by removing the fast or slow K conductance, but the slow K conductance was required to limit the repetitive response of the model to prolonged stimulating currents.},

abstract = {Computer simulations of stochastic single-channel open-close kinetics are applied to an N sodium channel model of a node of Ranvier. Up to 32,000 voltage-gated sodium channels have been simulated with modified amphibian sodium channel kinetics. Poststimulus time histograms are obtained with 1000 monophasic pulse stimuli, and measurements are made of changes in the relative spread of threshold (RS) with changes in the model parameters. RS is found to be invariant with pulse durations from 100 microseconds to 3 ms. RS is approximately of inverse proportion to square-root of N. It decreases with increasing temperature and is dependent on passive electrical properties of the membrane as well as the single-channel conductance. The simulated RS and its independence of pulse duration is consistent with experimental results from the literature. Thus, the microscopic fluctuations of single, voltage-sensitive sodium channels in the amphibian peripheral node of Ranvier are sufficient to account for the macroscopic fluctuation if threshold to electrical stimulation. {\textcopyright} 1995, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {In spite of many satisfactory results, the clinical outcome of cochlear implantation is poorly predictable and Further insight into the fundamentals of electrical nerve stimulation in this complex geometry is necessary. For this purpose we developed a rotationally symmetric volume conductor model of the implanted cochlea, using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). This configuration mimics the cochlear anatomy more closely than previous, unrolled models. The calculated potential distribution in the cochlea due to stimulating electrodes is combined with a multiple non-linear node model of auditory nerve fibres, which we recently developed. The combined model is used to compute excitation profiles of the auditory nerve for a variety of stimulus levels and electrode positions. The model predicts that the excitation threshold, the spatial selectivity and the dynamic range depend on the exact position of the electrode in the scala tympani. These results are in good agreement with recently published electrical ABR data. It is shown that the use of actively modelled nerve fibres is essential to obtain correct predictions for the biphasic stimuli typically used in cochlear implants and that unrolling the cochlear duct as done in previous models leads to erroneous predictions regarding modiolar stimulation.},

abstract = {1. The time constants of motor and sensory nerve fibres were studied in normal human ulnar nerves by the method of latent addition, using threshold tracking to follow the recovery of excitability after brief conditioning current pulses. The 60 microseconds test and conditioning stimuli were applied at the wrist, and the conditioning stimuli were set to 90, 60, 30, -30, -60 and -90{\%} of the control threshold current. Compound muscle action potentials were recorded from abductor digiti minimi, and sensory nerve action potentials from the little finger. 2. Recovery from depolarizing conditioning pulses was slower than recovery from hyperpolarizing pulses and strongly dependent on conditioning pulse amplitude. The voltage dependence of latent addition was attributed to subthreshold activation of sodium channels (local response). 3. Motor and sensory nerve excitability generally recovered from -90{\%} hyperpolarizing pulses as the sum of two exponential components, although the slow component was negligible in some motor nerves. The fast component (time constant 43.3 +/- 2.0 microseconds, mean +/- S.E.M., n = 9) was similar between motor and sensory fibres in the same subject. It showed no consistent voltage dependence, and was attributed to a passive input time constant of the fibres. The slow component of recovery from hyperpolarizing pulses was greater in sensory than in motor fibres and was voltage dependent: it could be greatly increased in motor and sensory fibres by steady depolarization. It was attributed to a regenerative membrane current, active at the resting potential in sensory and at least some motor nerves. 4. The latent addition responses were compared with the computed responses of four theoretical models. Both motor and sensory responses were well fitted by a model in which a fraction of the sodium channels (less in motor than in sensory fibres) were activated at potentials 20 mV more negative than normal and at half the normal rate, and did not inactivate. 5. It is concluded that the differences in latent addition between motor and sensory fibres are primarily due to differences in non-classical, voltage-dependent ion channels, active close to the resting potential. These "threshold channels' may help to account for the longer strength-duration time constant of sensory fibres, for their lower rheobase, and for their greater tendency to fire repetitively.},

abstract = {Abstract A hyperpolarization-activated current (tenned h) is believed to provide a pacemaker depolarization in sinoatrial node cells and in some central and peripheral neurons. In the present study, we examined if such an inward cation current exists in primary auditory neurons using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. A large inward, non-inactivating current was se{\~{}}n during hyperpolarizing steps negative to the resting potential. A depolarizing sag occurred during hyperpolarizing current injection, and upon tennination of the current injection there was an overshoot, or a rebound firing. A low concentration of Cs+, but not Ba2+, reversibly blocked the inward current and depolarizing sag. The activation of the current showed voltage dependence with half-activation occurring at -101 ± 1 mY. The time course of h activation was fitted by double exponential function and was voltage-dependent (time constants: 't'l and 't'; = 480 and 3125 ms at -100 m V, and 66 and 404 ms at -160 m V). The reversal potential of the current was -36 m V measured from tail currents. The conductance of the current was decreased in Na+ -free solution, and increased in high K+ solution. Increases in the levels of intracellular cAMP or cGMP enhanced the current. The results suggest that there exists a hyperpolarization-activated inward cation current in mammalian primary auditory neurons. This current may provide a depolarizing current during the membrane hyperpolarization following each firing of the primary auditory nerve. Keywords:},

Whole cell current and voltage-clamp techniques were used to show that the hyperpolarization-activated cationic (Ih) current underlies most or all of the inward rectification demonstrated in these neurons. The average reversal potential (-41.3 mV) and cesium sensitivity were typical of that found in other neurons and cell types. What was unique about the hyperpolarization-activated currents, however, was that the half-maximal voltages (V1/2) and slope factors (k) that characterized Ih current activation were graded from neuron to neuron. Voltage-clamp recordings made with standard bath and pipette solutions revealed V1/2 values that ranged from -78.1 to -122.1 mV, with slope factors from 7.6 to 13.1. These gradations in the voltage-dependent features of the Ih current did not result from variability in the recording conditions because independently measured Na+ current-to-voltage relationships were found to be uniform (peak current at -20 mV). Moreover, the range and average V1/2 and slope values could be altered with activators [8-(4-chlorophenylthio) adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate in combination with okadaic acid] or inhibitors {\{}N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide{\}}of protein indicating that Ih current heterogeneity most likely resulted from differential phosphorylation.},

First, it is shown that both the shape and slope of mean discharge rate curves are better predicted by the stochastic model than by the deterministic model. Second, while interpulse effects such as refractory effects do indeed increase the dynamic range at higher pulse rates, both the physiological data and the model indicate that much of the dynamic range for pulse-train stimuli is due to stochastic activity.

abstract = {The relationship between electrically evoked single-fiber action potentials and the electrically evoked compound action potential of the auditory nerve is of interest to those attempting to model such responses with computational techniques. It also relates to efforts to exploit the gross potentials that can now be recorded by some implantable cochlear prostheses. In this paper, we develop a computational model of the auditory nerve response to single, pulsatile, electrical stimuli based upon the response characteristics obtained from 230 single fibers of 13 cats. These fibers were stimulated by brief (39s) monophasic cathodic stimuli delivered by a monopolar intracochlear electrode. The data were pooled to obtain an estimate of the distribution of fiber thresholds. Post-stimulus time histograms were modeled using Poisson functions and adjusted to account for empirically determined latency and jitter characteristics. The probabilistic nature of single-fiber input-output functions (i.e. Verveen's (1961) 'relative spread') was also modelled. PST histograms from 5000 modelled fibers were then summed and convolved with an estimated 'unit potential' following the method of Goldstein and Kiang (1958). This convolution produced modelled compound action potentials, which were then compared with experimentally obtained data. Manipulations of model parameters affecting threshold, jitter, and relative spread suggest that the most important determinant of the shape of the EAP amplitude-level function is the threshold distribution. A model based solely on threshold distribution produces an EAP input-output function similar to one that accounts for probabilistic single-fiber input-output functions. Discrepancies between these two models do occur if the threshold distribution function is compressed significantly, as might be the case in pathological cochleae with altered distributions or numbers of nerve fibers.},

Fine tuning of only a few, not well-established parameters was performed by fitting the shape of a propagating action potential and its diameter-dependent propagation velocity. The quantitative behaviour of this model corresponds better to experimentally determined human fibre properties than other mammalian, nonhuman models do. Typical characteristics, such as the shape of the action potential, the propagation velocity and the strength-duration behaviour show a good fit with experimental data. The introduced diameter-dependent parameters did not result in a noticeable diameter dependency of action potential duration and refractory period.

abstract = {1. We investigated voltage-gated potassium channels in human peripheral myelinated axons; apart from the I, S and F channels already described in amphibian and rat axons, we identified at least two other channel types. 2. The I channel activated between -70 and -40 mV, and inactivated very slowly (time constant 13.1 s at -40 mV). It had two gating modes: the dominant ('noisy') mode had a conductance of 30 pS (inward current, symmetrical 155 mM K+) and a deactivation time constant (tau) of 25 ms (-80 mV); it accounted for most ( approximately 50-75 {\%}) of the macroscopic K+ current in large patches. The secondary ('flickery') gating mode had a conductance of 22 pS, and showed bi-exponential deactivation (tau = 16 and 102 ms -80 11 mV); it contributed part of the slow macroscopic K+ current. 3. The I channel current was blocked by 1 microM alpha-dendrotoxin (DTX); we also observed two other DTX-sensitive K+ channel types (40 pS and 25 pS). The S and F channels were not blocked by 1 microM DTX. 4. The conductance of the S channel was 7-10 pS, and it activated at slightly more negative potentials than the I channel; its deactivation was slow (tau = 41.7 ms at -100 mV). It contributed a second component of the slow macroscopic K+ current. 5. The F channel had a conductance of 50 pS; it activated at potentials between -40 and +40 V, deactivated very rapidly (tau = 1.4 ms at -100 mV), and inactivated rapidly (tau = 62 ms at +80 mV). It accounted for the fast-deactivating macroscopic K+ current and partly for fast K+ current inactivation. 6. We conclude that human and rat axonal K+ channels are closely similar, but that the correspondence between K+ channel types and the macroscopic currents usually attributed to them is only partial. At least five channel types exist, and their characteristics overlap to a considerable extent.},

Evidence exists indicating that the cell soma may alter the auditory neural response kinetics and could be the site of conduction failure for excitation initiated on the peripheral process. There is, however, reason to believe that the excitation site in some healthy, type I neurons and in pathological, type III neurons is the central process of the cell. To characterize the neural response to activation at a controlled central process site, cat auditory neurons were stimulated with an intrameatal electrode, and the summation and refraction response kinetics were measured. This approach was used to: (1) characterize the behavior of the neural response to central process excitation; (2) make comparisons between intrameatal excitation at a known central site and scala tympani excitation at an unknown site; and (3) provide membrane characterization free from the possible alteration of membrane kinetics produced by the cell soma. The membrane kinetics measured using intrameatal stimulation differ from those recorded with scala tympani stimulation indicating that the mechanisms for scala tympani and intrameatal stimulation differ.

abstract = {Voltage-gated sodium channels perform critical roles for electrical signaling in the nervous system by generating action potentials in axons and in dendrites. At least 10 genes encode sodium channels in mammals, but specific physiological roles that distinguish each of these isoforms are not known. One possibility is that each isoform is expressed in a restricted set of cell types or is targeted to a specific domain of a neuron or muscle cell. Using affinity-purified isoform-specific antibodies, we find that Na(v)1.6 is highly concentrated at nodes of Ranvier of both sensory and motor axons in the peripheral nervous system and at nodes in the central nervous system. The specificity of this antibody was also demonstrated with the Na(v)1.6-deficient mouse mutant strain med, whose nodes were negative for Na(v)1.6 immunostaining. Both the intensity of labeling and the failure of other isoform-specific antibodies to label nodes suggest that Na(v)1.6 is the predominant channel type in this structure. In the central nervous system, Na(v)1.6 is localized in unmyelinated axons in the retina and cerebellum and is strongly expressed in dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Ultrastructural studies indicate that labeling in dendrites is both intracellular and on dendritic shaft membranes. Remarkably, Na(v)1.6 labeling was observed at both presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes in the cortex and cerebellum. Thus, a single sodium channel isoform is targeted to different neuronal domains and can influence both axonal conduction and synaptic responses.},

abstract = {1. Potassium currents were measured in voltage-clamped single myelinated rat nerve fibres before and after paranodal demyelination with 0-2{\%} pronase or 0-2{\%} lysolecithin added to the external solution. Sodium currents were blocked by 300 nm- tetrodotoxin. For the purpose of comparison, intact frog nerve fibres were also investigated. 2. Our results suggest the existence of at least two distinct types of K+ channels in the intact node of Ranvier, one with slow and another with fast gating kinetics, in the ratio 4: 1. 3. In the rat nodal membrane, slow K+ channels have voltage-dependent time constants of K+ deactivation with rn = 68 ms at E = -105 mV and Tn = 26 ms at E = - 150 mV at 20 'C. The activation curve of the slow K+ conductance is sigmoid with an inflexion point at -60 mV. This means that about 35{\%} of the slow K+ channels are in the open state at the resting potential of -77 mV. Slow K+ channels could be blocked by 10 mM-tetraethylammonium chloride, but were insensitive to 4-aminopyridine. 4. After paranodal demyelination the ratio of fast to slow K+ channels increased from 17 to 83{\%}. As in the frog (Dubois, 1981 a), the population of fast K+ channels in the rat may consist of two different subgroups, both of which can be blocked by 4-aminopyridine. 5. Demyelination was accompanied by an increase in the capacity current which was used to estimate the exposed membrane area. The density of slow and fast K+ channels was calculated from the quotient of the steady-state K+ conductance to membrane area. The density of the slow K+ channels is maximal in the nodal membrane and decreases to 1/31 in the internode. By contrast, the distribution of the fast K+ channels differs, their density being maximal in the paranode and decreasing},

abstract = {Cochlear implants are electronic devices intended to restore the sense of hearing in deaf people by direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve fibres that are still present in the deaf inner ear. Unfortunately, the clinical outcome is not very predictable. In this study a computational model is presented that can predict the neural response to an arbitrary cochlear implant. It first computes the potential distribution set up in a three-dimensional, spiralling volume conduction model of the auditory part of the inner ear (cochlea) and then applies a nerve fibre model to construct input/output curves and excitation profiles of the auditory nerve. As an initial validation the results are compared with experimentally induced electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses. In the light of the favourable results, we conclude that the model can serve as a tool for designing future cochlear implants. In combination with electrophysiological measurements in the individual patient it is applicable as an implant fitting tool.},

abstract = {The refractory characteristics of auditory nerve fibers limit their ability to accurately encode temporal information. Therefore, they are relevant to the design of cochlear prostheses. It is also possible that the refractory property could be exploited by prosthetic devices to improve information transfer, as refractoriness may enhance the nerve's stochastic properties. Furthermore, refractory data are needed for the development of accurate computational models of auditory nerve fibers. We applied a two-pulse forward-masking paradigm to a feline model of the human auditory nerve to assess refractory properties of single fibers. Each fiber was driven to refractoriness by a single (masker) current pulse delivered intracochlearly. Properties of firing efficiency, latency, jitter, spike amplitude, and relative spread (a measure of dynamic range and stochasticity) were examined by exciting fibers with a second (probe) pulse and systematically varying the masker-probe interval (MPI). Responses to monophasic cathodic current pulses were analyzed. We estimated the mean absolute refractory period to be about 330 micros and the mean recovery time constant to be about 410 micros. A significant proportion of fibers (13 of 34) responded to the probe pulse with MPIs as short as 500 micros. Spike amplitude decreased with decreasing MPI, a finding relevant to the development of computational nerve-fiber models, interpretation of gross evoked potentials, and models of more central neural processing. A small mean decrement in spike jitter was noted at small MPI values. Some trends (such as spike latency-vs-MPI) varied across fibers, suggesting that sites of excitation varied across fibers. Relative spread was found to increase with decreasing MPI values, providing direct evidence that stochastic properties of fibers are altered under conditions of refractoriness.},

abstract = {Destruction of cochlear hair cells initiates degenerative changes within auditory nerve fibres (ANFs), including loss of peripheral processes and demyelination of the cell body. These changes are likely to affect the biophysical processes involved in action potential generation to an electrical stimulus. We measured the strength-duration relationship in acutely deafened (100{\%} ANF survival) versus long-term deafened cochleae (approximately 15{\%} ANF survival) by recording from single neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC). Input/output functions were constructed for 22 ICC neurons in response to stimulation of the auditory nerve using biphasic current pulses of 20-1000 micros/phase. Strength-duration curves were derived and found to be of the same general form for both acute and long-term deafened cochleae. While there was an increase in rheobase for neurons from long-term versus acute deafened cochleae, this increase was not statistically significant (p=0.097). In contrast, chronaxie--which is related to the membrane time constant--was significantly shorter in the long-term deafened cochleae (p = 0.004). This presumably reflects a shift in the site of action potential initiation to the larger diameter, heavily myelinated central axon as a result of the pathology. These changes in the site of action potential generation have implications for the delivery of charge to ANFs via cochlear implants.},

abstract = {Abstract—It is known that some cochlear implant users have improved speech perception using higher rates of interleaved pulsatile stimulation. There are, however, significant limitations on their performance presumably due in part to temporal and spatial interactions. To address these limitations, we have examined re- fractory characteristics of the auditory nerve using experimental animal models and computational simulations. A stochastic model of the node of Ranvier modified for mammalian sodium channel kinetics has been developed to calculate the masked input–output (I/O) functions for different interpulse intervals (IPI) [26]. The model is based upon 1000 voltage-gated sodium channels and incorporates parameters such as nodal resistance and capacitance. The relative spread (RS) [35] calculated from the I/O functions was typically 0.03 for 17 different IPIs between 450 s and 6 ms for cathodal stimuli. For s?s a 830 and 870 s, the RS was ten times greater than those for other IPIs. Although it is not fully understood howthe electrically evoked compound action potential (EAP) data are related to single fiber data, the RS of single fibers is a partial contributor [19]. We have measured the EAP using a monopolar intracochlear stimulating electrode and a recording electrode placed directly on the nerve and have observed changes in slope of EAP growth functions consistent with the theoretical RS values. These results have significant implications for speech coding in a cochlear implant since they suggest an increased membrane noise for pulse trains of specific rates.},

abstract = {Human nerve fibers exhibit a distinct pattern of threshold fluctuation following a single action potential known as the recovery cycle. We developed geometrically and elec- trically accurate models of mammalian motor nerve fibers to gain insight into the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the changes in axonal excitability and regulate the recovery cycle. The models de- veloped in this study incorporated a double cable structure, with explicit representation of the nodes of Ranvier, paranodal, and inter- nodal sections of the axon as well as a finite impedance myelin sheath. These models were able to reproduce a wide range of experimental data on the excitation properties of mammalian myelinated nerve fibers. The combination of an accurate representation of the ion channels at the node (based on experimental studies of human, cat, and rat) and matching the geometry of the paranode, internode, and myelin to measured morphology (necessitating the double cable rep- resentation) were needed to match the model behavior to the experi- mental data. Following an action potential, the models generated both depolarizing (DAP) and hyperpolarizing (AHP) afterpotentials. The model results support the hypothesis that both active (persistent Na? channel activation) and passive (discharging of the internodal axo- lemma through the paranodal seal) mechanisms contributed to the DAP, while the AHP was generated solely through active (slow K? channel activation) mechanisms. The recovery cycle of the fiber was dependent on the DAP and AHP, as well as the time constant of activation and inactivation of the fast Na? conductance. We propose that experimentally documented differences in the action potential shape, strength-duration relationship, and the recovery cycle of motor and sensory nerve fibers can be attributed to kinetic differences in their nodal Na? conductances.},

abstract = {Abstract Neurons from varied regions of the central nervous system can show widely divergent responses to electrical stimuli that are determined by cell-specific differences in ion channel composition. The well-ordered and highly characterized peripheral auditory system allows one to explore the significance of this diversity during the final stages of postnatal development. We examined the electrophysiological features of murine spiral ganglion neurons in vitro at a time when recordings could be made from the cell bodies before myelination. These cells carry information about sound stimuli from hair cell receptors in the basilar membrane and are arranged tonotopically. Spiral ganglion neuron responses to depolarizing current injection were assessed with whole-cell current clamp recordings from cells that were isolated separately from the apical and basal thirds of the mouse cochlea. These cells displayed systematic variation in their firing. Apex neurons (low frequency coding) showed longer latency, slowly adapting responses, whereas base neurons (high frequency coding) showed short latency, rapidly adapting responses to the same stimuli. This physiological diversity was mirrored by regional differences in ion channel content assessed immunohistochemically. Apex neurons had a preponderance of Kv4.2 subunits, whereas base neurons possessed greater levels of K(Ca), Kv1.1, and Kv3.1 subunits. Taken together, these results indicate that the distribution of a set of voltage-gated potassium channels may relate specifically to a particular range of coding frequencies. These studies also suggest that intrinsic properties of spiral ganglion neurons can contribute to the characteristic responses of the peripheral auditory system. Their potential role in development and adult function is discussed.},

abstract = {We have previously identified two broad electrophysiological classes of spiral ganglion neuron that differ in their rate of accommodation (Mo {\&} Davis, 1997a). In order to understand the underlying ionic basis of these characteristic firing patterns, we used alpha-dendrotoxin (alpha-DTX) to eliminate the contribution of a class of voltage-gated K(+) channels and assessed its effects on a variety of electrophysiological properties by using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Exposure to alpha-DTX caused neurons that initially displayed rapid accommodation to fire continuously during 240 ms depolarizing test pulses within a restricted voltage range. We found a non-monotonic relationship between number of action potentials fired and membrane potential in the presence of alpha-DTX that peaked at voltages between -40 to -10 mV and declined at more depolarized and hyperpolarized test potentials. The alpha-DTX-sensitive current had two components that activated in different voltage ranges. Analysis of recordings made from acutely isolated neurons gave estimated half-maximal activation voltages of -63 and 12 mV for the two components. Because alpha-DTX blocks the Kv1.1, Kv1.2 and Kv1.6 subunits, we examined the action of the Kv1.1-selective blocker dendrotoxin K (DTX-K). We found that this antagonist reproduced the effects of alpha-DTX on neuronal firing, and that the DTX-K-sensitive current also had two separate components. These data suggest that the transformation from a rapidly adapting to a slowly adapting firing pattern was mediated by the low voltage-activated component of DTX-sensitive current with a potential contribution from the high voltage-activated component at more depolarized potentials. In addition, the effects of DTX-K indicate that Kv1.1 subunits are important constituents of the underlying voltage-gated potassium channels.},

Four algorithms are compared in single-node models: Strassberg and DeFelice (1993) (SD), Rubinstein (1995) (R), Chow and White (1996) (CW), and Fox (1997) (F). Neural responses are simulated to a simple and a preconditioned monophasic current pulse. Three exact algorithms implementing Markov jumping processes (SD, R, CW) resulted in similar responses, while the approximation algorithm using Langevin's equation (F) showed quite different responses from those in the exact algorithms. The computational time was measured as well: 1(F), 7(CW), 32(SD), 39(R) relative to that of the F algorithm. Furthermore, it is shown that as the sampling step for integration of the transmembrane potential increases, neural responses in all algorithms tended to be different from those in dense sampling steps, however, the CW algorithm was robust even at a sparse sampling step. It is concluded that the most computationally efficient algorithm having appropriate properties of neural excitability is the CW algorithm.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the history of cochlear implant signal processing and provides the rationale underlying current approaches. Present strategies are explained and recent research findings are summarized. It is suggested how these results may drive future advancements in signal processing. RECENT FINDINGS: Substantial advances have been made in our understanding of the spectral and temporal cues necessary for cochlear implant recipients to perceive music, speech in noise, and interaural timing. It is clear that higher levels of both spectral and temporal resolution, as well as better loudness and pitch coding are necessary for higher levels of performance. These factors are highly interrelated, however, and are beneficial for differing aspects of hearing. Signal processing algorithms incorporating these findings are under active development and some are currently undergoing clinical investigation. SUMMARY: Current implant devices, and those soon to be available, have substantial untapped potential to improve the auditory experience of their recipients. It is likely that in the near future, recent findings on pitch and loudness perception, as well as techniques to better emulate the normal functions of the cochlea will result in much higher levels of prosthetic hearing fidelity than are possible today. As the performance of these remarkable devices continues to improve, the population of hearing-impaired individuals who can benefit from implantation is likely to increase significantly.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the effects of the electrode-to-fiber distance on the temporal response properties of an auditory nerve fiber stimulated by electric current pulses. This analysis was based upon results from a computational model of a mammalian auditory nerve fiber axon having 50 nodes of Ranvier, each consisting of 130 stochastic sodium channels and 50 stochastic potassium channels, making it possible to represent the temporal fluctuations of action potential initiation and conduction. A monopolar stimulus electrode was located above a central (26th) node at electrode-to-fiber distances of 1, 4, and 7 mm, while the recording electrode was located at the 36th node. Action potentials (spikes) were generated by the biophysical model using the Crank-Nicholson method to solve a diffusive partial differential equation. By observing the occurrence times of spikes in response to 2000 cathodic monophasic stimulus pulses, temporal jitter (i.e., the standard deviation of spike times) was calculated and the poststimulus time (PST) histogram was generated as well. Furthermore, by computing the PST histogram for each initiation node as functions of space (node number) and time (PST), it was shown that spike initiation was distributed not only spatially but also temporally for stimulus levels producing firing efficiencies (FEs) near 0.5. However, at levels producing FEs near 0.99, while temporal variations approached zero, the spatial distribution of initiating nodes was comparable to that observed for the FE near 0.5. As temporal fluctuations are important for speech coding in cochlear implants, we conclude that spatial characteristics of the electrode-auditory nerve fiber interface may play a significant role in influencing these stochastic temporal processes.},

abstract = {With the advent of eCAP recording tools such as NRT and NRI for cochlear implants, neural monitoring has become widely used to ascertain the integrity of the neural/electrode interface as well as for assisting in the setting of program levels. The basic concepts of eCAP recordings are deduced from the acoustical equivalent of the electrocochleogram. There are, however, indications that under electrical stimulation some of these do not hold, like the unitary response concept (i.e., the principle that every fiber produces the same contribution to the eCAP). Computer modeling has proven to be a valuable tool for gaining insight into the functioning of electrical stimulation. In this study the extension of a three-dimensional human cochlea, incorporating back-measuring capabilities, is described. Using this new model, the contribution of single fiber action potentials (SFAPs) to the measured eCAP is investigated. The model predicts that contrary to common belief - the compound action potential as measured by the cochlear implant system does not necessarily reflect the propagated action potential along the auditory nerve. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We undertook a systematic evaluation of spike rates and spike amplitudes of auditory nerve fiber (ANF) responses to trains of electric current pulses. Measures were obtained from acutely deafened cats to examine time-related changes free from the effects of hair-cell and synaptic adaptation. Such data relate to adaptation that likely occurs in ANFs of cochlear-implant users. A major goal was to determine and compare rate adaptation observed at different pulse rates (primarily 250, 1000, and 5000 pulse/s) and describe them using decaying exponential models similar to those used in acoustic studies. Rate-vs.-time functions were best described by two-exponent models and produced time constants similar to (although slightly greater than) the "rapid" and "short-term" components described in acoustic studies. There was little dependence of these time constants on onset spike rate, but pulse-rate effects were noted. Spike amplitude changes followed a time course different from that of rate adaptation consistent with a process related to ANF interspike intervals. The fact that two time constants governed rate adaptation in electrically stimulated and deafened fibers suggests that future computational models of adaptation should not only include hair cell and synapse components, but also components determined by fiber membrane characteristics.},

abstract = {Abstract Objective: This study had three main goals. The first goal was to assess the extent to which neural adaptation varied across cochlear implant users. The second goal was to determine whether adaptation at the level of the auditory nerve was correlated with word recognition ability. The third goal was to determine whether peripheral neural adaptation had an impact on the relationship between the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) thresholds and MAP levels. Design: Neural response telemetry software was used to record the ECAP in 21 Nucleus cochlear implant users. A series of 110 ECAP recordings were made over a 5-min period at three different stimulation rates: 15, 80, and 300 Hz. The stimulation levels used to record this series of responses were held constant at or near the level the subject identified as his or her maximum comfort level (C-level) for the 300-Hz stimulation rate. Consistent decreases in ECAP amplitude as measured from the beginning to the end of the 5-min stimulation interval were interpreted as evidence of neural adaptation. Regression analysis procedures were then used to assess the relationship between neural adaptation and word recognition. Results: Significant levels of adaptation were observed for all 21 subjects at stimulation rates of 80 and 300 Hz. Little or no adaptation was observed over the 5-min recording period when the 15-Hz rate was used. The amount of adaptation was greatest at the 300-Hz rate and varied substantially across cochlear implant users. No relationship between the amount of adaptation and word recognition was found. Neither was the degree of adaptation shown to influence the relationship between ECAP thresholds recorded at low rates and the levels used to program the speech processor. Conclusions: Cochlear implant users experienced varying degrees of long-term adaptation in response to continuous electrical stimulation. The effects of adaptation on the ECAP were apparent even at stimulation rates as low as 80 Hz. Although variations in the amount of adaptation are likely to reflect cross-subject differences in the status of the auditory nerve, no predictable relationship was found between these physiologic measures of peripheral neural function and either word recognition or the relationship between ECAP thresholds and MAP levels.},

abstract = {Most auditory prostheses use modulated electric pulse trains to excite the auditory nerve. There are, however, scant data regarding the effects of pulse trains on auditory nerve fiber (ANF) responses across the duration of such stimuli. We examined how temporal ANF properties changed with level and pulse rate across 300-ms pulse trains. Four measures were examined: (1) first-spike latency, (2) interspike interval (ISI), (3) vector strength (VS), and (4) Fano factor (FF, an index of the temporal variability of responsiveness). Data were obtained using 250-, 1,000-, and 5,000-pulse/s stimuli. First-spike latency decreased with increasing spike rate, with relatively small decrements observed for 5,000-pulse/s trains, presumably reflecting integration. ISIs to low-rate (250 pulse/s) trains were strongly locked to the stimuli, whereas ISIs evoked with 5,000-pulse/s trains were dominated by refractory and adaptation effects. Across time, VS decreased for low-rate trains but not for 5,000-pulse/s stimuli. At relatively high spike rates ({\textgreater}200 spike/s), VS values for 5,000-pulse/s trains were lower than those obtained with 250-pulse/s stimuli (even after accounting for the smaller periods of the 5,000-pulse/s stimuli), indicating a desynchronizing effect of high-rate stimuli. FF measures also indicated a desynchronizing effect of high-rate trains. Across a wide range of response rates, FF underwent relatively fast increases (i.e., within 100 ms) for 5,000-pulse/s stimuli. With a few exceptions, ISI, VS, and FF measures approached asymptotic values within the 300-ms duration of the low- and high-rate trains. These findings may have implications for designs of cochlear implant stimulus protocols, understanding electrically evoked compound action potentials, and interpretation of neural measures obtained at central nuclei, which depend on understanding the output of the auditory nerve.},

abstract = {An accurate model of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) would help in improving cochlear implant (CI) functionality. Previous studies have shown that the original Hodgkin-Huxley (1952) model (with kinetics adjusted for mammalian body temperature) may be better at describing nodes of Ranvier in ANFs than models for other mammalian axon types. However, the HH model is still unable to explain a number of phenomena observed in auditory nerve responses to CI stimulation such as long-term accommodation, adaptation and the time-course of relative refractoriness. Recent physiological investigations of spiral ganglion cells have shown the presence of a number of ion channel types not considered in the previous modeling studies, including low-threshold potassium (I(KLT)) channels and hyperpolarization-activated cation (I(h)) channels. In this paper we investigate inclusion of these ion channel types in a stochastic HH model. For single biphasic charge-balanced pulse, an increase in spike threshold was typically produced by inclusion of one or both of these channel types. The addition of I(KLT) increases random threshold fluctuations in the stochastic model, particularly for longer pulse widths. Pulse-train responses were investigated for pulse rates of 200, 800, and 2000 pulse/s. Initial results suggests that both the I(KLT) channels and I(h) channels can produce adaptation in the spike rate. However, the adaptation due to I(KLT) is restricted to higher stimulation rates, whereas the adaptation due to I(h) is observed across all stimulation rates.},

abstract = {The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model does not simulate the significant changes in auditory nerve fiber (ANF) responses to sustained stimulation that are associated with neural adaptation. Given that the electric stimuli used by cochlear prostheses can result in adapted responses, a computational model incorporating an adaptation process is warranted if such models are to remain relevant and contribute to related research efforts. In this paper, we describe the development of a modified HH single-node model that includes potassium ion ( K(+)) concentration changes in response to each action potential. This activity-related change results in an altered resting potential, and hence, excitability. Our implementation of K(+)-related changes uses a phenomenological approach based upon K(+) accumulation and dissipation time constants. Modeled spike times were computed using repeated presentations of modeled pulse-train stimuli. Spike-rate adaptation was characterized by rate decrements and time constants and compared against ANF data from animal experiments. Responses to relatively low (250 pulse/s) and high rate (5000 pulse/s) trains were evaluated and the novel adaptation model results were compared against model results obtained without the adaptation mechanism. In addition to spike-rate changes, jitter and spike intervals were evaluated and found to change with the addition of modeled adaptation. These results provide one means of incorporating a heretofore neglected (although important) aspect of ANF responses to electric stimuli. Future studies could include evaluation of alternative versions of the adaptation model elements and broadening the model to simulate a complete axon, and eventually, a spatially realistic model of the electrically stimulated nerve within extracochlear tissues.},

The Ranvier node model was extended to include a persistent sodium current and was incorporated into a generalised single cable nerve fibre model. Parameter temperature dependence was included. All calculations were performed in Matlab. Sensory nerve fibre excitability behaviour characteristics predicted by the new nerve fibre model at different temperatures and fibre diameters compared well with measured data. Absolute refractory periods deviated from measured data, while relative refractory periods were similar to measured data. Conduction velocities showed both fibre diameter and temperature dependence and were underestimated in fibres thinner than 12.5 microm. Calculated strength-duration time constants ranged from 128.5 to 183.0 micros at 37 degrees C over the studied nerve fibre diameter range, with chronaxie times about 30{\%} shorter than strength-duration time constants. Chronaxie times exhibited temperature dependence, with values overestimated by a factor 5 at temperatures lower than body temperature. Possible explanations include the deviated absolute refractory period trend and inclusion of a nodal strangulation relationship.},

abstract = {Synaptic transmission at the inner hair cell (IHC) afferent synapse, the first synapse in the auditory pathway, is specialized for rapid and reliable signaling. Here we investigated the properties of a hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)), expressed in the afferent dendrite of auditory nerve fibers, and its role in shaping postsynaptic activity. We used whole cell patch-clamp recordings from afferent dendrites directly where they contact the IHC in excised postnatal rat cochlear turns. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of variable amplitude (1-35 mV) were found with 10-90{\%} rise times of about 1 ms and time constants of decay of about 5 ms at room temperature. Current-voltage relations recorded in afferent dendrites revealed I(h). The pharmacological profile and reversal potential (-45 mV) indicated that I(h) is mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels. The HCN channel subunits HCN1, HCN2, and HCN4 were found to be expressed in afferent dendrites using immunolabeling. Raising intracellular cAMP levels sped up the activation kinetics, increased the magnitude of I(h) and shifted the half activation voltage (V(half)) to more positive values (-104 +/- 3 to -91 +/- 2 mV). Blocking I(h) with 50 microM ZD7288 resulted in hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential (approximately 4 mV) and slowing the decay of the EPSP by 47{\%}, suggesting that I(h) is active at rest and shortens EPSPs, thereby potentially improving rapid and reliable signaling at this first synapse in the auditory pathway.},

Threshold reductions were more pronounced for cathodic-first stimuli compared to anodic-first stimuli. Reversal of the phases in pseudomonophasic stimuli suggested a threshold reduction for anodic-first stimuli, but a threshold increase in cathodic-first stimuli. Inclusion of the persistent sodium and slow potassium currents in the model resulted in a reasonably accurate prediction of the non-monotonic threshold behaviour for pulse rates higher than 1000 pps. However, the model did not correctly predict the threshold changes observed for low pulse rate biphasic and alternating monophasic waveforms. It was suggested that these results could in part be explained by the difference in the refractory periods between real and simulated auditory nerve fibres, but also by the lack of representation of stochasticity observed in real auditory nerve fibres in our auditory nerve model. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper describes results from a stochastic computational neuron model that simulates the effects of rate adaptation on the responses to electrical stimulation in the form of pulse trains. We recently reported results from a single-node computational model that included a novel element that tracks external potassium ion concentration so as to modify membrane voltage and cause adaptation-like responses. Here, we report on an improved version of the model that incorporates the anatomical components of a complete feline auditory nerve fiber (ANF) so that conduction velocity and effects of manipulating the site of excitation can be evaluated. Model results demonstrate rate adaptation and changes in spike amplitude similar to those reported for feline ANFs. Changing the site of excitation from a central to a peripheral axonal site resulted in plausible changes in latency and relative spread (i.e., dynamic range). Also, increasing the distance between a modeled ANF and a stimulus electrode tended to decrease the degree of rate adaptation observed in pulse-train responses. This effect was clearly observed for high-rate (5,000 pulse/s) trains but not low-rate (250 pulse/s) trains. Finally, for relatively short electrode-to-ANF distances, increases in modeled ANF diameter increased the degree of rate adaptation. These results are compared against available feline ANF data, and possible effects of individual parameters are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract The random transitions of ion channels between conducting and nonconducting states generate a source of internal fluctuations in a neuron, known as channel noise. The standard method for modeling the states of ion channels nonlinearly couples continuous-time Markov chains to a differential equation for voltage. Beginning with the work of R. F. Fox and Y.-N. Lu [Phys. Rev. E 49, 3421 (1994)], there have been attempts to generate simpler models that use stochastic differential equation (SDEs) to approximate the stochastic spiking activity produced by Markov chain models. Recent numerical investigations, however, have raised doubts that SDE models can capture the stochastic dynamics of Markov chain models. We analyze three SDE models that have been proposed as approximations to the Markov chain model: one that describes the states of the ion channels and two that describe the states of the ion channel subunits. We show that the former channel-based approach can capture the distribution of channel noise and its effects on spiking in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a degree not previously demonstrated, but the latter two subunit-based approaches cannot. Our analysis provides intuitive and mathematical explanations for why this is the case. The temporal correlation in the channel noise is determined by the combinatorics of bundling subunits into channels, but the subunit-based approaches do not correctly account for this structure. Our study confirms and elucidates the findings of previous numerical investigations of subunit-based SDE models. Moreover, it presents evidence that Markov chain models of the nonlinear, stochastic dynamics of neural membranes can be accurately approximated by SDEs. This finding opens a door to future modeling work using SDE techniques to further illuminate the effects of ion channel fluctuations on},

abstract = {Chronaxie, a historically introduced excitability time parameter for electrical stimulation, has been assumed to be closely related to the time constant of the cell membrane. Therefore, it is perplexing that significantly larger chronaxies have been found for intracellular than for extracellular stimulation. Using compartmental model analysis, this controversy is explained on the basis that extracellular stimulation also generates hyperpolarized regions of the cell membrane hindering a steady excitation as seen in the intracellular case. The largest inside/outside chronaxie ratio for microelectrode stimulation is found in close vicinity of the cell. In the case of monophasic cathodic stimulation, the length of the primarily excited zone which is situated between the hyperpolarized regions increases with electrode-cell distance. For distant electrodes this results in an excitation process comparable to the temporal behavior of intracellular stimulation. Chronaxie also varies along the neural axis, being small for electrode positions at the nodes of Ranvier and axon initial segment and larger at the soma and dendrites. As spike initiation site can change for short and long pulses, in some cases strength-duration curves have a bimodal shape, and thus, they deviate from a classical monotonic curve as described by the formulas of Lapicque or Weiss. {\textcopyright} 2012 IBRO.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our knowledge about the neural code in the auditory nerve is based to a large extent on experiments on cats. Several anatomical differences between auditory neurons in human and cat are expected to lead to functional differences in speed and safety of spike conduction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Confocal microscopy was used to systematically evaluate peripheral and central process diameters, commonness of myelination and morphology of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) along the cochlea of three human and three cats. Based on these morphometric data, model analysis reveales that spike conduction in SGNs is characterized by four phases: a postsynaptic delay, constant velocity in the peripheral process, a presomatic delay and constant velocity in the central process. The majority of SGNs are type I, connecting the inner hair cells with the brainstem. In contrast to those of humans, type I neurons of the cat are entirely myelinated. Biophysical model evaluation showed delayed and weak spikes in the human soma region as a consequence of a lack of myelin. The simulated spike conduction times are in accordance with normal interwave latencies from auditory brainstem response recordings from man and cat. Simulated 400 pA postsynaptic currents from inner hair cell ribbon synapses were 15 times above threshold. They enforced quick and synchronous spiking. Both of these properties were not present in type II cells as they receive fewer and much weaker (∼26 pA) synaptic stimuli.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Wasting synaptic energy boosts spike initiation, which guarantees the rapid transmission of temporal fine structure of auditory signals. However, a lack of myelin in the soma regions of human type I neurons causes a large delay in spike conduction in comparison with cat neurons. The absent myelin, in combination with a longer peripheral process, causes quantitative differences of temporal parameters in the electrically stimulated human cochlea compared to the cat cochlea.},

abstract = {Despite advances in technology, the ability to perceive music remains limited for many cochlear implant users. This paper reviews the technological, biological, and acoustical constraints that make music an especially challenging stimulus for cochlear implant users, while highlighting recent research efforts to overcome these shortcomings. The limitations of cochlear implant devices, which have been optimized for speech comprehension, become evident when applied to music, particularly with regards to inadequate spectral, fine-temporal, and dynamic range representation. Beyond the impoverished information transmitted by the device itself, both peripheral and central auditory nervous system deficits are seen in the presence of sensorineural hearing loss, such as auditory nerve degeneration and abnormal auditory cortex activation. These technological and biological constraints to effective music perception are further compounded by the complexity of the acoustical features of music itself that require the perceptual integration of varying rhythmic, melodic, harmonic, and timbral elements of sound. Cochlear implant users not only have difficulty perceiving spectral components individually (leading to fundamental disruptions in perception of pitch, melody, and harmony) but also display deficits with higher perceptual integration tasks required for music perception, such as auditory stream segregation. Despite these current limitations, focused musical training programs, new assessment methods, and improvements in the representation and transmission of the complex acoustical features of music through technological innovation offer the potential for significant advancements in cochlear implant-mediated music perception. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract Implementation of double cablemodels to simulate the behavior of myelinated peripheral nerve fibers requires defining a segmentation of the internode between successive nodes of Ranvier. The number of internodal segments is a model parameter that is not well agreed on, with values in the literature ranging from1 to more than 500. Moreover, a lot of studies also lack a sensitivity study or a rationale behind the implementation used. In a model of a myelinated nerve fiber developed in our group, the segmentation scheme (i.e., the number of segments and their individual morphology) strong- ly influenced model outcomes such as action potential shape and velocity, stimulation threshold and absolute refractory period. In the present study these influenceswere investigated systematically in homogeneous neurons with different diam- eters. Uniformly segmented internodes were found to require several hundreds of segments (and associated computational power) to reach model outcomes differing by less than 1 {\%} from the asymptotic value. In fact, in the majority of segmen- tation schemes the main determinant is not the number of segments, but the length $\lambda$ of the internodal segments directly adjacent to the nodes of Ranvier. If $\lambda$ is larger than approxi- mately 10 $\mu$m,model outcomes for the tested fibers are almost independent of the total number of segments. Furthermore, $\lambda$ can be optimized to enable models using just three segments per internode, to reach physiologically relevant model out- comes with limited computational resources. However, to study anatomical or physiological details of the internode itself, an appropriately detailed segmentation scheme is crucial. Action},

abstract = {Place pitch was investigated in a computational model of the implanted human cochlea containing nerve fibres with realistic trajectories that take the variable distance between the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion into account. The model was further updated from previous studies by including fluid compartments in the modiolus and updating the electrical conductivity values of (temporal) bone and the modiolus, based on clinical data. Four different cochlear geometries are used, modelled with both lateral and perimodiolar implants, and their neural excitation patterns were examined for nerve fibres modelled with and without peripheral processes. Additionally, equations were derived from the model geometries that describe Greenwood's frequency map as a function of cochlear angle at the basilar membrane as well as at the spiral ganglion. The main findings are: (I) in the first (basal) turn of the cochlea, cochlear implant induced pitch can be predicted fairly well using the Greenwood function. (II) Beyond the first turn this pitch becomes increasingly unpredictable, greatly dependent on stimulus level, state of the cochlear neurons and the electrode's distance from the modiolus. (III) After the first turn cochlear implant induced pitch decreases as stimulus level increases, but the pitch does not reach values expected from direct spiral ganglion stimulation unless the peripheral processes are missing. (IV) Electrode contacts near the end of the spiral ganglion or deeper elicit very unpredictable pitch, with broad frequency ranges that strongly overlap with those of neighbouring contacts. (V) The characteristic place pitch for stimulation at either the organ of Corti or the spiral ganglion can be described as a function of cochlear angle by the equations presented in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An accurate model of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) may assist in developing improved cochlear implant (CI) stimulation strategies. Previous studies have shown that the original Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model may be better at describing nodes of Ranvier in ANFs than models for other mammalian axon types. However, the HH model is still unable to explain a number of phenomena observed in auditory nerve responses to CI stimulation such as adaptation to high-rate stimulation and the time-course of relative refractoriness. Recent physiological investigations of auditory nerve fibers have shown the presence of a number of ion channel types not considered in the previous modeling studies, including low-threshold potassium (KLT) channels and hyperpolarization-activated cation (HCN) channels. In this paper we investigate inclusion of these ion channel types in a stochastic HH model of a single node of Ranvier. Simulation results for pulse-trains with rates of 200, 800, and 2000 pulse/s suggests that both the KLT channels and HCN channels can produce adaptation in the spike rate. However, the adaptation due to KLT is restricted to higher stimulation rates, whereas the adaptation due to HCN is observed across all stimulation rates. Additionally, using pulse pairs it was found that KLT increased both the absolute and the relative refractory periods. HCN on its own increased just the relative refractory period, but produced a synergistic increase in the absolute refractory period when combined with KLT. Together these results argue strongly for the need to consider HCN and KLT channels when studying CI stimulation of ANFs.},

abstract = {Several multipolar current focussing strategies are examined in a computational model of the implanted human cochlea. The model includes a realistic spatial distribution of cell bodies of the auditory neurons throughout Rosenthal's canal. Simulations are performed of monopolar, (partial) tripolar and phased array stimulation. Excitation patterns, estimated thresholds, electrical dynamic range, excitation density and neural recruitment curves are determined and compared. The main findings are: (I) Current focussing requires electrical field interaction to induce spatially restricted excitation patterns. For perimodiolar electrodes the distance to the neurons is too small to have sufficient electrical field interaction, which results in neural excitation near non-centre contacts. (II) Current focussing only produces spatially restricted excitation patterns when there is little or no excitation occurring in the peripheral processes, either because of geometrical factors or due to neural degeneration. (III) The model predicts that neural recruitment with electrical stimulation is a three-dimensional process; regions of excitation not only expand in apical and basal directions, but also by penetrating deeper into the spiral ganglion. (IV) At equal loudness certain differences between the spatial excitation patterns of various multipoles cannot be simulated in a model containing linearly aligned neurons of identical morphology. Introducing a form of variability in the neurons, such as the spatial distribution of cell bodies in the spiral ganglion used in this study, is therefore essential in the modelling of spread of excitation.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled {\textless}Lasker Award{\textgreater}.},

abstract = {Auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) play a crucial role in hearing by encoding and transporting the synaptic input from inner hair cells into afferent spiking information for higher stages of the auditory system. If the inner hair cells are degenerated, cochlear implants may restore hearing by directly stimulating the ANFs. The response of an ANF is affected by several characteristics of the electrical stimulus and of the ANF, and neurophysiological measurements are needed to know how the ANF responds to a particular stimulus. However, recording from individual nerve fibers in humans is not feasible and obtaining compound neural or psychophysical responses is often time-consuming. This motivates the design and use of models to estimate the ANF response to the electrical stimulation. Phenomenological models reproduce the ANF response based on a simplified description of ANF functionality and on a limited parameter space by not directly describing detailed biophysical mechanisms. Here, we give an overview of phenomenological models published to date and demonstrate how different modeling approaches can account for the diverse phenomena affecting the ANF response. To highlight the success achieved in designing such models, we also describe a number of applications of phenomenological models to predict percepts of cochlear implant listeners.

abstract = {This study presents the development of an alternative noise current term and novel voltage-dependent current noise algorithm for conductance-based stochastic auditory nerve fibre (ANF) models. ANFs are known to have significant variance in threshold stimulus which affects temporal characteristics such as latency. This variance is primarily caused by the stochastic behaviour or microscopic fluctuations of the node of Ranvier's voltage-dependent sodium channels of which the intensity is a function of membrane voltage. Though easy to implement and low in computational cost, existing current noise models have two deficiencies: it is independent of membrane voltage, and it is unable to inherently determine the noise intensity required to produce in vivo measured discharge probability functions. The proposed algorithm overcomes these deficiencies while maintaining its low computational cost and ease of implementation compared to other conductance and Markovian-based stochastic models. The algorithm is applied to a Hodgkin–Huxley-based compartmental cat ANF model and validated via comparison of the threshold probability and latency distributions to measured cat ANF data. Simulation results show the algorithm's adherence to in vivo stochastic fibre characteristics such as an exponential relationship between the membrane noise and transmembrane voltage, a negative linear relationship between the log of the relative spread of the discharge probability and the log of the fibre diameter and a decrease in latency with an increase in stimulus intensity.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTIn the last few decades, biophysical models have emerged as a prominent tool in the study and improvement of cochlear implants, a neural prosthetic that restores a degree of sound perception to the profoundly deaf. Owing to the spatial phenomena associated with extracellular stimulation, these models have evolved to a relatively high degree of morphological and physiological detail: single-node models in the tradition of Hodgkin–Huxley are paired with cable descriptions of the auditory nerve fiber. No singular model has emerged as a frontrunner to the field; rather, parameter sets deriving from the channel kinetics and morphologies of numerous organisms (mammalian and otherwise) are combined and tuned to foster strong agreement with response properties observed in vivo, such as refractoriness, summation, and strength–duration relationships. Recently, biophysical models of the electrically stimulated auditory nerve have begun to incorporate adaptation and stochastic mechanisms, in order to better r...},

abstract = {Cochlear implants (CIs) rehabilitate hearing impairment through direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. New stimulation strategies can be evaluated using computational models. In this study, a computationally efficient model that accurately predicts auditory nerve responses to CI pulse train input was developed. A three-dimensional volume conduction and active nerve model developed at Leiden University Medical Center was extended with stochasticity, adaptation, and accommodation. This complete model includes spatial and temporal characteristics of both the cochlea and the auditory nerve. The model was validated by comparison with experimentally measured single fiber action potential responses to pulse trains published in the literature. The effects of pulse rate and pulse amplitude on spiking patterns were investigated. The modeled neural responses to CI stimulation were very similar to the single fiber action potential measurements in animal experiments. The model's responses to pulse train stimulation with respect to spatial location were also investigated. Adaptation was stronger at the borders of the stimulated area than in the center. By combining spatial details with long-term temporal components and a broad implementation of stochasticity a comprehensive model was developed that was validated for long duration electric stimulation of a wide range of pulse rates and amplitudes. The model can be used to evaluate auditory nerve responses to cochlear implant sound coding strategies.},

abstract = {A computational model of cat auditory nerve fiber (ANF) responses to electrical stimulation is presented. The model assumes that (1) there exist at least two sites of spike generation along the ANF and (2) both an anodic (positive) and a cathodic (negative) charge in isolation can evoke a spike. A single ANF is modeled as a network of two exponential integrate-and-fire point-neuron models, referred to as peripheral and central axons of the ANF. The peripheral axon is excited by the cathodic charge, inhibited by the anodic charge, and exhibits longer spike latencies than the central axon; the central axon is excited by the anodic charge, inhibited by the cathodic charge, and exhibits shorter spike latencies than the peripheral axon. The model also includes subthreshold and suprathreshold adaptive feedback loops which continuously modify the membrane potential and can account for effects of facilitation, accommodation, refractoriness, and spike-rate adaptation in ANF. Although the model is parameterized using data for either single or paired pulse stimulation with monophasic rectangular pulses, it correctly predicts effects of various stimulus pulse shapes, stimulation pulse rates, and level on the neural response statistics. The model may serve as a framework to explore the effects of different stimulus parameters on psychophysical performance measured in cochlear implant listeners.},

abstract = {The study presents the application of a purely conductance-based stochastic nerve fibre model to human auditory nerve fibres within finite element volume con-duction models of a semi-generic head and user-specific cochleae. The stochastic, threshold and temporal characteris-tics of the human model are compared and successfully vali-dated against physiological feline results with the application of a mono-polar, bi-phasic, cathodic first stimulus. Stochastic characteristics validated include: (i) the log(Relative Spread) versus log(fibre diameter) distribution for the discharge prob-ability versus stimulus intensity plots and (ii) the required exponential membrane noise versus transmembrane voltage distribution. Intra-user, and to a lesser degree inter-user, com-parisons are made with respect to threshold and dynamic range at short and long pulse widths for full versus degenerate single fibres as well as for populations of degenerate fibres of a single user having distributed and aligned somas with vary-ing and equal diameters. Temporal characteristics validated through application of different stimulus pulse rates and dif-ferent stimulus intensities include: (i) discharge rate, latency and latency standard deviation versus stimulus intensity, (ii) period histograms and (iii) interspike interval histograms. Although the stochastic population model does not reduce the modelled single deterministic fibre threshold, the sim-ulated stochastic and temporal characteristics show that it could be used in future studies to model user-specific tem-porally encoded information, which influences the speech perception of CI users.},

abstract = {Cochlear implants (CIs) are used to restore the sense of hearing in people with profound hearing loss. SomeCI users can communicate over the phone and even understand speechwith some background noise,whereas some other CI users do not obtain the same benefit from the device. Due to differences in the interface between the electrodes and the auditory nerves, the best settings of the CImay be different for each user. In order to improve the fitting ofCIs and to understand the electrode-nerve interface, a user-specific model of the auditory nerve activity has been developed. The model is based on a combination of existing models found in the literature. This chapter presents the basic components of the model:Athree-dimensional finite element method to estimate the voltage distribution in the cochlea; and an audi- tory nerve model based on multi-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley-type equations fit- ted to known electrophysiological measurements. Using the above described model, intracochlear voltage distributions are reproduced. Additionally, amplitude growth functions of the evoked compound action potential (ECAP) were simulated using an artifact rejection forward masking paradigm. The model has been parameterized such that it can be personalized to each CI user by fitting its parameters to predict the individual voltage distributions and amplitude growth functions. The modeling results show that different amounts of nerve density and nerve degeneration lead to different shapes in the amplitude growth function. The future goal of the model is to create a tool to predict the most comfortable level of each CI user and to fit CI parameters in a personalized clinical situation.},
